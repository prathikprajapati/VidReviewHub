# VidReviewHub
VidReviewHub is a platform designed to streamline the collaboration between YouTubers and video editors. It allows YouTubers to review and approve video content, including metadata and thumbnails, before it's uploaded to their YouTube channel. This ensures privacy and control over the final content, even with limited internet connectivity.
